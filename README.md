## CAT 2

## Question 1: Object-Oriented Programming Concepts in Java
### (a) Encapsulation
-> Implements a `Student` class with private attributes `name` and `grade`.
-> Uses public getter and setter methods to access and modify these attributes.
-> Ensures the grade is always within `0 to 100`, defaulting to `0` if out of range.

### (b) Method Overloading and Overriding
-> `Math` demonstrates **method overloading** with two `multiply()` methods.
-> `Animal` class defines a `makeSound()` method, overridden in `Dog` and `Cat` subclasses.
-> `Main.java` demonstrates **polymorphism** by calling `makeSound()` on different objects.

## Question 2: Abstraction and Exception Handling
### (a) Abstraction
-> Defines an abstract class `Appliance` with an abstract method `turnOn()`.
-> Implements `Fan` and `TV` classes, each providing its own `turnOn()` method.
-> `Main.java` creates objects and demonstrates **abstraction**.

### (b) Exception Handling
- `Division.java` provides a `divide()` method that prevents division by zero.
- `Main.java` handles user input, catches exceptions, and ensures the program doesn't crash.
- Exception handling includes `ArithmeticException` and `NumberFormatException`.
